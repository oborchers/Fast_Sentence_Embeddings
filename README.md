Fast Sentence Embeddings (fse)
==================================

Fast Sentence Embeddings is a Python library that serves as an addition to Gensim. This library is intended to compute *sentence vectors* for large collections of sentences or documents. 

**Disclaimer**: I am working full time. Unfortunately, I have yet to find time to add all the features I'd like to see. Especially the API needs some overhaul and we need support for gensim 4.0.0.

I am looking for active contributors to keep this package alive. Please feel free to ping me at <o.borchers@oxolo.com> if you are interested.

Audience
------------

This package builds upon Gensim and is intenteded to compute sentence/paragraph vectors for large databases. Use this package if:
- (Sentence) Transformers are too slow
- Your dataset is too large for existing solutions (spacy)
- Using GPUs is not an option.

The average (online) inference time for a well optimized (and batched) sentence-transformer is around 1ms-10ms per sentence.
If that is not enough and you are willing to sacrifice a bit in terms of quality, this is your package.


Features
------------

- [Visualizing 100,000 Amazon Products](https://towardsdatascience.com/vis-amz-83dea6fcb059)
- [Sentence Embeddings. Fast, please!](https://towardsdatascience.com/fse-2b1ffa791cf9)

**fse** implements three algorithms for sentence embeddings. You can choose
between *unweighted sentence averages*,  *smooth inverse frequency averages*, and *unsupervised smooth inverse frequency averages*. 

Key features of **fse** are: 

**[X]** Up to 500.000 sentences / second (1)

**[X]** Supports Average, SIF, and uSIF Embeddings

**[X]** Full support for Gensims Word2Vec and all other compatible classes

**[X]** Full support for Gensims FastText with out-of-vocabulary words

**[X]** Induction of word frequencies for pre-trained embeddings

**[X]** Incredibly fast Cython core routines 

**[X]** Dedicated input file formats for easy usage (including disk streaming)

**[X]** Ram-to-disk training for large corpora

**[X]** Disk-to-disk training for even larger corpora

**[X]** Many fail-safe checks for easy usage

**[X]** Simple interface for developing your own models

**[X]** Extensive documentation of all functions

**[X]** Optimized Input Classes

(1) May vary significantly from system to system (i.e. by using swap memory) and processing.
I regularly observe 300k-500k sentences/s for preprocessed data on my Macbook (2016).
Visit **Tutorial.ipynb** for an example.


Installation
------------

This software depends on NumPy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Gensim, and Wordfreq. 
You must have them installed prior to installing fse.

As with gensim, it is also recommended you install a BLAS library before installing fse.

The simple way to install **fse** is:

    pip install -U fse

In case you want to build from source, just run:

    python setup.py install

If building the Cython extension fails (you will be notified), try:

    pip install -U git+https://github.com/oborchers/Fast_Sentence_Embeddings

Usage
-------------

Within the folder nootebooks you can find the following guides:

**Tutorial.ipynb** offers a detailed walk-through of some of the most important functions fse has to offer.

**STS-Benchmarks.ipynb** contains an example of how to use the library with pre-trained models to
replicate the STS Benchmark results [4] reported in the papers.

**Speed Comparision.ipynb** compares the speed between the numpy and the cython routines.

In order to use the **fse** model, you first need some pre-trained gensim 
word embedding model, which is then used by **fse** to compute the sentence embeddings.

After computing sentence embeddings, you can use them in supervised or
unsupervised NLP applications, as they serve as a formidable baseline.

The models presented are based on
- Deep-averaging embeddings [1]
- Smooth inverse frequency embeddings [2]
- Unsupervised smooth inverse frequency embeddings [3]

Credits to Radim Řehůřek and all contributors for the **awesome** library
and code that [Gensim](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim) provides. A whole lot of the code found in this lib is based on Gensim.

In order to use **fse** you must first estimate a Gensim model which contains a
gensim.models.keyedvectors.BaseKeyedVectors class, for example 
*Word2Vec* or *Fasttext*. Then you can proceed to compute sentence embeddings
for a corpus.

	from gensim.models import FastText
	sentences = [["cat", "say", "meow"], ["dog", "say", "woof"]]
	ft = FastText(sentences, min_count=1, size=10)

	from fse.models import Average
	from fse import IndexedList
	model = Average(ft)
	model.train(IndexedList(sentences))

	model.sv.similarity(0,1)

fse offers multi-thread support out of the box. However, for most
applications a *single thread will most likely be sufficient*.
