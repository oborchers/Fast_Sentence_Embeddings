"""This module implements the base class to compute average representations for sentences, using highly optimized C routines,
data streaming and Pythonic interfaces.

The implementation is based on Iyyer et al. (2015): Deep Unordered Composition Rivals Syntactic Methods for Text Classification.
For more information, see <https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/pubs/2015_acl_dan.pdf>.

The training algorithms is based on the Gensim implementation of Word2Vec, FastText, and Doc2Vec. 
For more information, see: :class:`~gensim.models.word2vec.Word2Vec`, :class:`~gensim.models.fasttext.FastText`, or
:class:`~gensim.models.doc2vec.Doc2Vec`.

    This is the non-optimized, pure Python version. If you have a C compiler,
    fse will use an optimized code path from :mod:`fse.models.average_inner` instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : :class:`~fse.models.base_s2v.BaseSentence2VecModel`
        The BaseSentence2VecModel model instance.
    indexed_sentences : iterable of tuple
        The sentences used to train the model.
    target : ndarray
        The target ndarray. We use the index from indexed_sentences

    memory : ndarray
        Private memory for each working thread

    Returns
    -------
    int, int
        Number of effective sentences (non-zero) and effective words in the vocabulary used

    Attributes
    ----------
    wv : :class:`~gensim.models.keyedvectors.BaseKeyedVectors`

    sv : :class:`~fse.models.sentencevectors.SentenceVectors`
        This object contains the sentence vectors inferred from the training data. There will be one such vector
        for each unique docusentence supplied during training. They may be individually accessed using the index.

    prep : :class:`~fse.models.base_s2v.BaseSentence2VecPreparer`
        The prep object is used to transform and initialize the sv.vectors. Aditionally, it can be used
        to move the vectors to disk for training with memmap.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model : :class:`~gensim.models.keyedvectors.BaseKeyedVectors` or :class:`~gensim.models.base_any2vec.BaseWordEmbeddingsModel`
            This object essentially contains the mapping between words and embeddings. To compute the sentence embeddings
            the wv.vocab and wv.vector elements are required.
        sv_mapfile_path : str, optional
            Optional path to store the sentence-vectors in for very large datasets. Used for memmap.
        wv_mapfile_path : str, optional
            Optional path to store the word-vectors in for very large datasets. Used for memmap.
            Use sv_mapfile_path and wv_mapfile_path to train disk-to-disk without needing much ram.
        workers : int, optional
            Number of working threads, used for multithreading. For most tasks (few words in a sentence)
            a value of 1 should be more than enough.
        lang_freq : str, optional
            Some pre-trained embeddings, i.e. "GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin", do not contain information about
            the frequency of a word. As the frequency is required for estimating the word weights, we induce
            frequencies into the wv.vocab.count based on :class:`~wordfreq`
            If no frequency information is available, you can choose the language to estimate the frequency.
